## Work in progress 

* *Neighbourhood effects and job search behaviors* (with [Marie Aurélie Lapierre](https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/), submitted)    
This article aims to test the influence of interactions with neighbors on the job-seeking behavior of unemployed
individuals. Using data from the 2014-2019 Employment Surveys, which identify two nested levels of neighborhoods,
we estimate a model of endogenous and contextual effects à la Manski (1993) applied to different job search
methods. 

* *A dynamic perspective on preferences for residential density* (with [Yves Schaeffer](https://lessem.lyon-grenoble.hub.inrae.fr/membres/yves-schaeffer))   
This project aims to provide a better understanding of household demand for residential density. Existing work
does not take into account the effect of past residential densities on location choices. The aim is to fill this
gap by estimating dynamic panel data models on cohorts of French people followed from late childhood to
adulthood over several decades, from 1968 to 2013.

* *Public housing sellings and housing markets* (with [Romain Durand](https://durandro.github.io/) and [Paavo Monkkonen](https://global.luskin.ucla.edu/faculty-members/paavo-monkkonen/))   
The aim of this work is to measure the interactions between the private housing market and
housing sales by social landlords, in order to highlight the impact of the local housing market situation on
the sales behavior of social landlords, who may seek to sell in high-value neighborhoods in order to generate
resources, in line with their plans to build new housing, or on the contrary sell low-value assets.

* *Low-income housing location* (with [Dionissi Aliprantis](https://www.dionissialiprantis.com))  
The aim of this project is to analyze the effects of the spatial distribution of social housing on public housing tenants. 

* *Urban renewal and housing markets*       
The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the evaluation of the French Urban Renewal Programm (PNRU) published in *Regional Science and Urban Economics* in 2022. The aim is twofold. On the one hand, I analyse in greater depth the effects of the PNRU on housing prices over a longer period, paying
particular attention to the characteristics of the operations carried out. Secondly, the effects on the social
categories of sellers and buyers is considered, with the aim of assessing the effects in terms of the social
recomposition of renovated neighborhoods.
