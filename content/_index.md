I am a CNRS Research Professor at the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict (CERGIC), at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon.

My primary research areas are housing and urban economics, focusing on policies, residential segregation, and the relationship between residence and labor market outcomes. 

Together with Geoffrey Caruso at the University of Luxembourg, I am the recipient of a research grant from the French National Research Agency (ANR) on "Cities at wORk: Job Location and Inequalities" (Corjolis, 2026-2029).

I am the co-organizer of the [Public Policies, Cities, and Regions workshops](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/ppcrworkshops), 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2025.

I have supervised several PhD students in recent years. Modibo Sidibé (assistant professor at Duke University before to joining the World Bank), [Zhejin Zhao](https://zhaozhejin.weebly.com/) (assistant professor at the School of Economics and Management, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China), [Tidiane Ly](https://www.tidianely.com/) (postdoctoral fellow at the NBER before to joining Syracuse University), [Yohann Trouvé](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/yohann-trouv%C3%A9-sargison-01682547) (chargé d'études Agirc), [Marie Aurélie Lapierre](https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/) (post-doc at LED at the Université Paris Dauphine-PSL). 

Before joining the Cergic, I was affiliated with GATE at the University of Lyon 2, after spending a couple of years at the University of Burgundy in Dijon. I visited the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank in fall 2022, and the CORE in Louvain-la-Neuve in 1997.
