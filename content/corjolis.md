Corjolis is a PRCI project that brings together economists and geographers from four partner institutions:    
- Department of Geography and Spatial Planning , Univ. of Luxembourg (Co-PI Geoffrey Caruso)    
- Cergic, ENS de Lyon (PI, Florence Goffette-Nagot)    
- IDEES, UMR at Univ. of Rouen (Co-PI, Rémi Lemoy)    
- GATE, UMR 5824, Univ. Jean Monnet, Saint-Etienne (Co-PI Mathieu Sanch-Maritan)   

**Keywords:** job location, intra-urban inequalities, models of
urban geography, scaling laws and urban gradients.

**Abstract**

In France, as in other developed countries, recent years have seen an increase in geographical
inequalities, both between cities and within cities. We are also witnessing a polarization of the
labor market, i.e. a decline in the proportion of medium-skilled jobs. The result of these two
trends is an increase in income inequalities within cities, particularly the larger ones, and a
heightened risk of residential segregation, which can reinforce inequalities through neighborhood
effects.
CORJOLIS will study the mechanisms by which changes in the labor market affect the internal
structure of cities and intra-urban inequalities in the case of France. The project will result in
four main contributions:
(i) a unique database at sub-municipal level, on firms and jobs, workers’ characteristics and
residential location, and housing prices;
(ii) an extended description of job and household location patterns according to their
characteristics, based on a method combining statistical physics and spatial analysis tools;
(iii) an analysis of the effects of changes in job location and work organization on residential
segregation measured at city and local levels;
(iv) an analysis of the effects of changes in job location and residential segregation on individual
inequalities on the labor market.
The combination of economics and geography, with two partners in economics and two partners
in geography specializing in spatial analysis, will enable innovative analyses based on the
combination of theoretical frameworks in urban economics, original spatial analysis methods
derived from statistical physics, and econometric analyses.
