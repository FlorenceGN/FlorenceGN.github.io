### **Short presentation**

In France, as in other developed countries, recent years have seen an increase in geographical inequalities, both between cities and within cities. We are also witnessing a polarization of the labor market, i.e. a decline in the proportion of medium-skilled jobs. The result of these two trends is an increase in income inequalities within cities, particularly the larger ones, and a heightened risk of residential segregation, which can reinforce inequalities through neighborhood effects.

**CORJOLIS** will study the mechanisms by which changes in the labor market affect the **internal structure of cities and intra-urban inequalities in the case of France**. The project will result in four main contributions:

(i) a unique database at sub-municipal level, on firms and jobs, workers’ characteristics and residential location, and housing prices;

(ii) an extended description of job and household location patterns according to their characteristics, based on a method combining statistical physics and spatial analysis tools;

(iii) an analysis of the effects of changes in job location and work organization on residential segregation measured at city and local levels;

(iv) an analysis of the effects of changes in job location and residential segregation on individual inequalities on the labor market.

The combination of economics and geography, with two partners in economics and two partners in geography specializing in spatial analysis, will enable innovative analyses based on the combination of theoretical frameworks in urban economics, original spatial analysis methods derived from statistical physics, and econometric analyses.
